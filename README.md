## :closed_book: Abstract

This project was born out of a love for bread of all kinds. We decided to create an interactive resource connecting a user to breads from across the world. With just a click on a map, a list of breads with cultural information about the tradition of bread-making from that country is displayed, allowing the user to learn more about regional breads. Selecting a bread displays more specific information about that type of bread and also shows a recipe. We wanted to showcase not only the diversity and variety of breads of the world but provide a recipe for the user to adventure into recreating it at home. 
<br></br>
We are currently working on Part 1 of the project in which our information is from a handrolled Rails database but in Part 2, we plan to utilize AI to generate a much bigger variety of options for every country in the world. Leveraging AI in this way will allow us to focus on performance and user experience rather than populating a database with information for thousands of breads.
<br></br>
## :book: Context
This project was created in an 11 day sprint and is currently in v1 stage of the two-part Capstone project. It was designed, engineered and created by a full-stack team in mod 4 at Turing School of Software and Design.

### :space_invader: Challenges 
- Looking for and then deciding to build our own bread APIs
- Integrating an interactive mapping component with Leaflet
- Creating two iterations, the first built for our C# API and this one for our Rails API

### :dizzy: Wins
- Utilizing Leaflet mapping with a custom GeoJSON file for our countries
- Group teamwork made planning, communication, and collaboration very smooth
- Refactoring this repo for a restructured JSON response after forking off the C# iteration
